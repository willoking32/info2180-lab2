					<h2>FRANCE JUST RAIDED THE OFFICES OF NVIDIA </h2>

					French authorities just paid an early morning visit to the offices of Nvidia, one of the world's foremost computer chip manufacturers and a red-hot player in the AI arms race.
					<br>

					On Wednesday, the French Competition Authority (FCA) announced that it had raided a company in the "graphics cards sector," but did not specify which one. Since then, multiple outlets have confirmed that the target was Nvidia.
					<br>
					The FCA says it had authorization from a judge for the raid, conducted as part of an inquiry into anti-competitive practices by the chipmaker.

					In this regard, Nvidia is not alone. The European Union has been playing hardball with big tech corporations, preparing to enact sweeping regulation to keep the influence of the industry in check.
					<br>
					In June, the FCA released a report on its probe into the cloud computing industry, investigating whether potential monopolism by companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft could be affecting competition in other industries that depend on their services, namely cloud gaming and AI.
					<br>
					While the Wall Street Journal notes that Nvidia wasn't specifically named in the FCA report, the fact that it has enormous pull in both sectors would make it a prime suspect

					<h2>What is DLSS? </h2>

					DLSS is an acronym for Deep Learning Super Sampling and it is an Nvidia RTX feature that uses artificial intelligence to boost a game’s framerate performance higher, coming in handy when your GPU is struggling with intensive workloads.
					<br>
					When using DLSS, your GPU essentially generates an image at a lower resolution to lessen the strain on the hardware, and then it adds additional pixels to upscale the picture to the desired resolution, using AI to determine what the final image should look like.
					<br>
					And as many of us will know, bringing your GPU down to a lower resolution will result in a significant frame rate boost, which is what makes DLSS technology so appealing, as you’re getting both high frame rates and a high resolution.
